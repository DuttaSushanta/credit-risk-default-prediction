# Credit Risk Prediction Project

This repository contains all the code, data, and documents for the Credit Risk Prediction project.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict loan status (default or non-default) using the Credit Risk dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset). The project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model evaluation to identify the most effective model.
